# 🌍 Project Overview

**Rising Waters** is an AI-powered flood prediction system designed to provide **early flood risk assessments** using Machine Learning and environmental data analysis. The system analyzes critical weather and geographical parameters to determine the likelihood of flood occurrences and assists communities, governments, and disaster management agencies in making proactive decisions.

Floods are among the most destructive natural disasters, causing:

* Loss of human lives
* Destruction of infrastructure
* Agricultural damage
* Economic losses
* Displacement of communities
* Long-term environmental impacts

With increasing climate change and unpredictable weather patterns, traditional monitoring methods are often insufficient. **Rising Waters** bridges this gap by utilizing data-driven intelligence to predict flood risks before they become catastrophic.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Natural disasters such as floods occur with little warning and often result in devastating consequences. Existing systems rely heavily on manual observations and delayed reporting.

The objective of this project is to build an intelligent system capable of:

* Predicting flood occurrence.
* Providing early warnings.
* Assisting in disaster preparedness.
* Supporting data-driven decision-making.
